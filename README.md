# 📝 Note Taking App (Flutter + Hive)

A minimal text editor that saves your thoughts permanently on the device. This project teaches **Local Database Storage** using Hive, a popular NoSQL alternative to SQLite.

<div align="center" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; gap: 16px;">

</div>

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- **Hive Database:** Initializing, opening boxes, and reading/writing data.
- **Persistence:** Saving data to the device's file system.
- **ValueListenableBuilder:** Automatically rebuilding the UI whenever the database changes (no manual `setState` needed for the list!).
- **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on a persistent database.

## 📱 Features
- **Auto-Save:** Notes are saved immediately when added.
- **Persistent Storage:** Data remains even after killing the app.
- **Delete:** Swipe or tap to remove notes permanently.
- **Clean UI:** A simple grid or list view of your thoughts.
